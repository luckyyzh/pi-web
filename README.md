# Pi Web

[中文文档](./README.zh-CN.md) | [日本語](./README.ja.md) | [Русский](./README.ru.md)

Local browser UI for the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). Pi Web uses the same local configuration and session files as pi, so you can browse and resume conversations, run agent turns, configure models and resources, and inspect project files from a browser.

## Features

- **Session workspace**: browse, resume, rename, export, and delete conversations grouped by project, with running state, context usage, cost, and compaction details.
- **Two ways to branch**: **New session** creates an independent session file from an earlier message; **Edit from here** creates a branch inside the current session.
- **Project file tools**: browse and upload files, inspect Git diffs, and preview source, Markdown, images, audio, PDFs, and DOCX files with automatic refresh.
- **Git worktrees**: switch checkouts from the sidebar while keeping sessions from the same repository grouped together.
- **Web-based configuration**: manage provider login and API keys, models, model tests, plugin packages, and skills without leaving Pi Web.
- **English and Simplified Chinese UI**: Pi Web follows the browser language initially and provides a language switcher in the top bar.

## Quick Start

Pi Web requires Node.js 22.19.0 or newer. Check your version with `node --version`, then run:

```bash
npx @agegr/pi-web@latest
```

The CLI opens a browser after the server is ready. If it does not, open [http://127.0.0.1:30141](http://127.0.0.1:30141). Pi Web listens only on `127.0.0.1` by default.

If no model provider is configured yet, open the **Models** panel to sign in or add an API key.

To install the `pi-web` command globally:

```bash
npm install -g @agegr/pi-web@latest
pi-web
```

To update, stop the running process with `Ctrl+C` and run the same install command again. To uninstall, run `npm uninstall -g @agegr/pi-web`.

## Configuration

For port and hostname, command-line options override the corresponding environment variables. Either `--no-open` or `PI_WEB_NO_OPEN=1` disables automatic browser opening.

| Option or environment variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--port <port>`, `-p <port>`, or `PORT` | Server port | `30141` |
| `--hostname <host>`, `-H <host>`, or `PI_WEB_HOSTNAME` | Bind hostname | `127.0.0.1` |
| `--no-open` or `PI_WEB_NO_OPEN=1` | Do not open a browser automatically | Browser opens |
| `PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Additional exact proxy or custom hostnames, comma-separated | Unset |
| `PI_WEB_PASSWORD` | Enable HTTP Basic Auth; the username is always `pi` | Authentication disabled |

For example:

```bash
pi-web -p 8080 -H 0.0.0.0 --no-open
```

### Remote Access

Binding to a non-loopback address exposes an agent that can execute high-privilege actions. On a trusted LAN, require a long random password:

```bash
PI_WEB_PASSWORD='a-long-random-password' pi-web --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

Basic Auth does not encrypt the password in transit. Do not expose Pi Web over plain HTTP to the internet; use HTTPS through a trusted reverse proxy or a trusted VPN. If a reverse proxy sends an external hostname, add that exact name to `PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. This allow-list does not change the address Pi Web binds to.

### HTTP Proxy

Server-side model and API requests honor the standard `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables.

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 \
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 \
npx @agegr/pi-web@latest
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:HTTP_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:7890"
$env:NO_PROXY = "localhost,127.0.0.1"
npx @agegr/pi-web@latest
```

## Features

- **Pick work back up**: browse previous pi conversations by project without digging through terminal history or session paths.
- **Try different directions safely**: continue from an earlier message or fork a session into a separate route.
- **Work across branches**: switch Git worktrees from the sidebar so new sessions and the Explorer follow the checkout you choose.
- **Chat beside the project**: browse files on the left and preview source, docs, images, audio, and PDFs on the right while the agent works.
- **See session state clearly**: context usage, cost, compaction state, and system prompt details are visible from the top bar.
- **Configure less from the terminal**: manage models, login/API keys, model tests, and skill switches from the web UI.
- **Use the interface in your language**: switch between the supported UI languages from the top bar.

## Remote SSH Workspace

Work on a remote machine right from the web UI: point pi-web at a remote server, pick a remote working directory, and browse/edit files, check Git status, and run agent tools (read / write / edit / bash) against the remote via SSH.

**Requires the `ssh` pi extension.** It forwards the agent's `read` / `write` / `edit` / `bash` tools to the remote host and maps local shadow directories to remote paths. You need SSH key-based auth (no password prompt) on the target host.

### Enable

1. Click the **Remote** button in the bottom bar (globe icon) to open the SSH config dialog.
2. If the `ssh` extension is not installed yet, the dialog shows a **one-click install** button — click it (a new session / pi-web restart is needed for the extension to load).
3. Fill in the SSH target (`user@host`) and, optionally, a remote working directory (empty = login directory). Click **Test connection**, then **Enable remote mode**.

Once enabled, pi-web automatically switches the working directory to the remote one (shown as `⛁ user@host:/path`), the file explorer lists the remote directory, sessions are grouped per remote directory, and Git status/diff run against the remote repository.

### Behavior

- Each remote directory gets its own **shadow root** (`~/.pi/remote/<host>_<hash>`), which keeps sessions, `AGENTS.md`, and project trust isolated per remote path — switching back to a previous directory restores its sessions.
- **Remote mode** toggles the working directory automatically: enabling switches to the login directory, disabling switches back to your previous local directory.
- The `ssh` extension also works from the CLI (`pi --ssh user@host[:path]`) and via the `/ssh` command (`/ssh user@host[:path]` to enable, `/ssh off` to exit).
- SSH config is persisted in `~/.pi/agent/ssh-config.json`.

## Persona & Cache Hit Rate

- **User persona**: use the **Persona** tab (next to System in the top bar) to view/edit your global persona, persisted in `~/.pi/agent/persona.md`. It is injected into the system prompt on every turn by the built-in `persona-injector` extension (auto-installed, no extra plugin needed) and takes effect on your next message.
- **Cache hit rate**: shown in the top-right token bar (next to input/output/cache-read) as `cacheRead / (input + cacheRead)` for the current session.

## Notes

- **Agent data**: Pi Web reads pi data from `~/.pi/agent` by default, including session files under `sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`. Set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to use another pi agent directory.
- **Filesystem access**: Pi Web must be able to read the agent data directory and the working directories recorded by its sessions. Run Pi Web in the same filesystem environment as pi when sharing existing sessions.
- **Shared configuration**: the Models panel uses pi's model, settings, and credential storage, so changes are visible to both interfaces.
- **File access boundary**: the file browser is limited to working directories selected in Pi Web and project or session roots it already knows about; it is not a general filesystem browser.
- **Git worktrees**: see [Worktrees in Pi Web](./docs/worktrees.md) for switcher visibility, worktree creation, and removal behavior.

### Downstream Session Context Menu

Electron wrappers and other downstream integrations can provide a session-row
context menu without patching `SessionSidebar`. Listen for the cancelable
`pi-web:session-row-contextmenu` browser event and call `preventDefault()`
synchronously when the integration will handle it:

```js
window.addEventListener("pi-web:session-row-contextmenu", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const { id, path, cwd, name, clientX, clientY, refresh } = event.detail;

  void openSessionMenu({ id, path, cwd, name, clientX, clientY }).then((changed) => {
    if (changed) refresh();
  });
});
```

The detail object contains `id`, `path`, `cwd`, optional `name`, pointer
coordinates, and a `refresh()` callback for actions that change the session
list. If no listener cancels the extension event, Pi Web preserves the
browser's native context menu. This hook is browser-side and independent of
Pi agent extensions.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs at [http://127.0.0.1:30141](http://127.0.0.1:30141). Run the common checks with:

```bash
npm test
node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
```

Do not run `next build` or `npm run build` during normal development. It writes to `.next/` and can interfere with the development server; leave builds for release work.
